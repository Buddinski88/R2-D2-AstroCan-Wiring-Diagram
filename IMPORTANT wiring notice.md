# R2-D2 Wiring Diagram â€“ Read Before Use!

## Important Wiring Notice ðŸ›‘

This diagram was created to the best of my knowledge, but I do not take any responsibility for potential damage or malfunctions. Do **not rely 100% on this diagram** - **always verify your wiring independently!**

### General Notes

- **Boards from printed-droid.com:** The blue-highlighted boxes represent boards from printed-droid.com. Where possible, I have included the specific board revisions I used. Please compare them with your versions - different revisions may require different wiring (have a look in the [files section](https://www.printed-droid.com/files/)).
- **Not all wires are shown:** Standard connections, such as power/ground/signal for servos, are not explicitly drawn. For Teeces boards, please refer to the [official documentation](http://joymonkey.com/run/files/V3.2%20Kit%20Sheet%20Sept%202012.pdf).
- **Wire gauge selection:** The wire gauge used in this diagram was chosen for my setup. Depending on your configuration, different wire sizes may be required.
- **Connections & jumpers:** Not all available connections or jumper settings of the boards are included in the diagram. Further details can be found at **[printed-droid.com](https://shop.printed-droid.com/)** and **[nextgenastromech.net](https://nextgenastromech.net/)**.

### Additional Safety Notes

- **Power supply & polarity:** Make sure to use the correct voltage for your components and avoid reversing polarity. Incorrect power connections can damage your electronics.
- **Fuses & protection measures:** Depending on your power requirements, it may be advisable to include fuses or protection circuits (e.g., PTC fuses) to prevent damage.
- **Heat buildup & cooling:** Some components, such as voltage regulators or motor drivers, may generate heat during operation. Ensure adequate cooling if necessary.
- **EMI & interference:** Long or poorly shielded cables can cause interference. If you experience signal transmission issues, check your cable routing and consider using shielded wires.
- **Ground loops & noise:** Avoid ground loops, especially when using multiple boards and power sources. Improper grounding can lead to erratic behavior or signal issues.
- **Separate power circuits:** If your R2-D2 uses multiple independent power circuits (e.g., 5V for logic, 12V for motors), ensure they are properly isolated to prevent voltage drops or overvoltage damage.

âž¡ **Always double-check your wiring before powering up your system! ðŸš€**
