## How did I mount the electronics in my R2-D2?

I have drawn my own design in Fusion360 and published it on GitHub.
If you are interested, please have a look at this page: [R2D2 Modular control unit (MCU)](https://github.com/Buddinski88/R2-D2-Modular-control-unit) or better go directly to [Makerworld](https://makerworld.com/de/models/664782#profileId-592188) where you can download the files via Bambu Lab.
